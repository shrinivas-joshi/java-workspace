# java-workspace

This is a project where applications of java features is uploaded. 

**Data Structures =>** 
  1. Singly Linked List.
  2. Doubly Linked List.
  3. Stacks
  4. HashMap


**Implementations In The Project:**
1. **Find Middle Node In A Linked List** <br/>
   Class: src > com > java > implementations > linkedlist > LinkedList.java <br/>
   Method:  findMiddleNode() <br/>
   To get the middle node in a linked list, we have made use of slow-fast pointer technique.<br/>
   Also known as **Floyd's Tortoise and Hare Algorithm**Details about this algorithm => https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_detection. <br/>
2. **Reverse String Using stack**<br/>
   Class: src > com > java > implementations > stack > Main.java <br/>
   Method:  reverseString() <br/>
3. **Find if two arrays have any common element** <br/>
   Class: src > com > java > implementations > hashMap > Main.java <br/>
   Method:  itemInCommon() <br/>
